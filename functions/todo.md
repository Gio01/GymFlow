> FITNESS PAGE:
Monthly Progress:
* [ ] Should I change the Line graph or is this a good representation for the user data
* [ ] Should I include some other graphical data as well?
* [ ] I need to get more user reviews on this product!

Bar Chart -> 
* [ ] Since I am using monthly data for their fitness page I need to only display the data from that specific month
    and not show other data
        > There should also be an option to where the user could see their previous monthly data. 
* [ ] Include more workouts to be able to input as data
    > Allow the user to be able to create their own workouts and use that as reference to store as data for the graphing

FatSecret API:
* [ ] Create accounts with FatSecret at the moment that a user signs up so the user does not have to 
    sign up for both my website and then FatSecret. As well as only having to log into my website and
    automatically being logged in for FatSecret.

> PROGRAM PAGE:
* [ ] Create a templated diet program based on what I have done with my Excel Sheets
> Explain the reasoning and some background info on how the body works with some cited articles 
> Create a simple workout routine you can do at home and combine it with the diet program
> Make it seem easy to use via the fitness tab so that users can not only have an example on how to use
    the app but also be more inclined to use it because there is a guide
* [ ] Decrease the top padding from the Program box div

> LOGIN/REGISTER PAGE:
* [ ] Make the Login form responsive when you enlarge the page vertically. (horizontally is working)

> Future Ehancements
* [ ] Purchase a Domain? 
	> I can purchase a domain name at GoDaddy but I need to keep paying a yearly fee 
* [ ] More user reviews
* [ ] Spread the beta version of this app
> Get as many people to use this to get an idea about what features to add or things to change
* [ ] Add this to my blog page (Once I actually make the vlog page)
* [ ] Create a social forum so that users can communicate with other users
* [ ] Delete some of the data after some period of time to limit the size of the DB and lessen query time?
